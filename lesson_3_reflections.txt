When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working on a collaborated project, code can be hosted in a github public repo, to which others can contribute.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	We would like to have some control over the contents in our repository. Thats what git is all about.
