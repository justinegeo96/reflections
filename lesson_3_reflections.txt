When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working on a collaborated project, code can be hosted in a github public repo, to which others can contribute.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	We would like to have some control over the contents in our repository. Thats what git is all about.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	fork - cloning within github repos.
	clone - copying files and file history ( basically the whole repo ) from github to local machine, or within github repos.
	branches - different path for our program to grow into, so in a later stage, a merging can be done ( Handled in the same repo).
